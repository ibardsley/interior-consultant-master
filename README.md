Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience? This was a challenge to complete all the responsive aspects and took me much longer than I had hoped
- What have you learned/improved? I feel I have improved at visualizing the responsive break points and making the adjustments needed.
    I also learned about using positioning and Z index to get my menu to overlay the other sections.
- Your wisdom? :) Practice Practice Practice, use the google dev tool for responsive pages and watch what you are doing as you go
